## Outstanding issues
+ In both SKA-Low and SKA-Mid, all PSS and PST beams get the same frequency setup. 
+ In both SKA-Low and SKA-Mid, it is assumed that all zoom windows are in the same zoom mode. 
+ The tool assumes we are in AA* and so only has those default values. 
+ Need to make sure that the range limits are all correct.
